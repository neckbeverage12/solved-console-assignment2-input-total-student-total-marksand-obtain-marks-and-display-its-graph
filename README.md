</ol>

Write a program that takes an integer as an input and determine if it is a binary number? For instance, 1010 is a binary number but 1012 is not.

<h1>2.  Exponentiation</h1>

Write a program that can compute the value of e<sup>x</sup>, for a given value of x, using Taylor series expansion, as follows:

e<sup>x</sup> = 1 + x + (x<sup>2</sup> / 2!) + (x<sup>3</sup> / 3!) + (x<sup>4</sup> / 4!) + (x<sup>5</sup> / 5!) + â€¦.

The more the series is expanded, greater the accuracy. Take number of terms, for accuracy, as an input.

<h1>3.  Line Printing</h1>

Write a program that takes as an input parameters of a linear line and print a line using asterisks. For instance, the following line will be printed for y = 2x + 1 and end points (0,1) and (3,7):
